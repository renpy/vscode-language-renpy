# Changelog

## 805.1.0

* Stable release.
* New versioning scheme. 805 means it's for Ren'Py 8.5. Odd minor versions
  represent stable releases, even minor versions represent development releases,
  and patches are an index in the series.

## 8.6.0

* Mistakenly published stable release.
* Arguments passed to the shell by tasks are now quoted by VS Code, allowing the
  commands to work even if spaces are in the directory names.

## 8.5.0

* Prerelease.
* Update to match Ren'Py 8.5. This includes screen properties, ATL properties, and
  the API.
* Syntax highlighting for the test sub-language.
* Ren'Py injection for _ren.py and markdown files.
* Use Child process for debugging instead of a terminal.

## 2.4.x

* The first stable release targeting Ren'Py 8.3.

## 2.3.x

* Development of Ren'Py language has moved to the Ren'Py project.
* Updated the Ren'Py API to match the in-development version of Ren'Py 8.3.
