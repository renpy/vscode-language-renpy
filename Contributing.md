## Code Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting. Please ensure your code is properly formatted before submitting a pull request.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run format` - Format all files using Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check if files are formatted correctly
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check for code quality issues

### Editor Integration

If you're using VS Code (recommended), Prettier is already configured as the default formatter for TypeScript files. The workspace settings enable "format on save", so your code will be automatically formatted when you save files.

For other editors, install the Prettier extension/plugin and configure it to use the project's `.prettierrc.json` configuration file.

### Before Submitting

Before submitting a pull request, please run:

```bash
npm run format        # Format your code
npm run format:check  # Verify formatting is correct
npm run lint          # Check for linting issues
```

Tips:

If you're working on syntax features, add the following textmate rule to your vscode `settings.json` file:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
   "textMateRules": [
   {
      "scope": "debug.invalid.illegal.unmatched.renpy",
      "settings": {
         "foreground": "#f00"
      }
   },
}
```

This will make any unmatched tokens red.

Use ctrl+alt+shift+i to display the vscode build-in token debug information.

## Additional Information

### Extension Versions

There are two versions: **release** and **pre-release**. Because [VS Code only supports](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions) `major.minor.patch` and not the additional [semver](https://semver.org/) labels for pre-releases, to know if a version is a pre-release or final release, check its `minor` number:

* `major.EVEN_NUMBER.patch` for final releases.
* `major.ODD_NUMBER.patch` for pre-releases.
