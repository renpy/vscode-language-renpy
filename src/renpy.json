It is passed a\nsingle argument, the object returned from parse.\n\n`predict`\nThis is a function that is called to predict the images used by the statement.\nIt is passed a single argument, the object returned from parse. It should return\na list of displayables used by the statement.\n\n`next`\nThis is a function that is called to determine the next statement.\n\nIf `block` is not \"script\", this is passed a single argument, the object\nreturned from the parse function. If `block` is \"script\", an additional\nargument is passed, an object that names the first statement in the block.\n\nThe function should return either a string giving a label to jump to,\nthe second argument to transfer control into the block, or None to\ncontinue to the statement after this one. It can also return the result\nof Lexer.renpy_statement or Lexer.renpy_block when\ncalled in the `parse` function.\n\n`label`\nThis is a function that is called to determine the label of this\nstatement. If it returns a string, that string is used as the statement\nlabel, which can be called and jumped to like any other label.\n\n`warp`\nThis is a function that is called to determine if this statement\nshould execute during warping. If the function exists and returns\ntrue, it's run during warp, otherwise the statement is not run\nduring warp.\n\n`scry`\nUsed internally by Ren'Py.\n\n`init`\nTrue if this statement should be run at init-time. (If the statement\nis not already inside an init block, it's automatically placed inside\nan init block.)\n\nYou probably don't want this if you have an `execute_init` function,\nas wrapping the statement in an init block will cause the `execute_init`\nand `execute` functions to be called at the same time.\n\n`translatable`\nIf set to true, the statement will be included in a translation\nblock, generally the block containing the succeding say statement.\nThis may only be set to true for one-line statements. It's used\nfor statements like ``nvl clear`` and ``voice``, which may need\nto be changed with dialogue.\n\n`init_priority`\nAn integer that determines the priority of initialization of the\ninit block created by `init` and `execute_init` function.\n\n`translation_strings`\nA function that is called with the parsed block. It's expected to\nreturn a list of strings or tuples of (string line number, string),\nwhich are then reported as being available to be translated.\n\n`force_begin_rollback`\nThis should be set to true on statements that are likely to cause the\nend of a fast skip, similar to ``menu`` or ``call screen``.\n\n`post_execute`\nA function that is executed as part the next statement after this\none. (Adding a post_execute function changes the contents of the RPYC\nfile, meaning a Force Compile is necessary.)\n\n`post_label`\nThis is a function that is called to determine the label of this\nthe post execute statement. If it returns a string, that string is used\nas the statement label, which can be called and jumped to like any other\nlabel. This can be used to create a unique return point.\n\n`predict_all`\nIf True, then this predicts all sub-parses of this statement and\nthe statement after this statement.\n\n`predict_next`\nThis is called with a single argument, the label of the statement\nthat would run after this statement.\n\nThis should be called to predict the statements that can run after\nthis one. It's expected to return a list of of labels or SubParse\nobjects. This is not called if `predict_all` is true.\n\n`execute_default`\nThis is a function that is called at the same time the default\nstatements are run - after the init phase, but before the game starts; when the\na save is loaded; after rollback; before lint; and potentially at\nother times.\n\nThis is called with a single argument, the object returned from parse.\n\n`reachable`\nThis is a function that is called to allow this statement to\ncustomize how it participates in lint's reachability analysis.\n\nBy default, a statement's custom block, sub-parse blocks created\nwith Lexer.renpy_block(), and the statement after the statement\nare reachable if the statement itself is reachable. The statement\nis also reachable if it has a label function.\n\nThis can be customized by providing a reachable function. This is\na function that takes five arguments (in the following, a \"label\"\nmay be a string or an opaque object):\n\n* The object returned by the parse function.\n* A boolean that is true if the statement is reachable.\n* The label of the statement.\n* The label of the next statement, or None if there is no next statement.\n* If `block` is set to \"script\", the label of the first statement in the block,\nor None if there is no block.\n\nIt's expected to return a set that may contain:\n\n* A label or subparse object of a statement that is reachable.\n* True, to indicate that this statement should not be reported by lint,\nbut is not intrinsically reachable. (It will become reachable if it\nis reported reachable by another statement.)\n* None, which is ignored.\n\nThis function may be called multiple times with both value of is_reachable,\nto allow the statement to customize its behavior based on whether it's\nreachable or not. (For example, the next statement may only be reachable\nif this statement is.)\n\n**Warning:**\n\nUsing the empty string as the name to redefine the say statement is\nusually a bad idea. That is because when replacing a Ren'Py native\nstatement, its behavior depends on the statement_equivalents. In\nthe case of the say statement, these equivalents do not support the `id`\nand translation systems. As a result, a game redefining the default\nstatement will not be able to use these features (short of\nreimplementing them entirely).\n\n"

It's\nexpected to return a list of [ (drag, x, y) ] tuples, giving\nthe draggables to drag as a unit. `x` and `y` are the offsets\nof the drags relative to each other, they are not relative\nto the corner of this drag. `drag` is either the Drag object\nto be joined or the drag_name of such a Drag.\n\n`drag_offscreen`\nDetermines the conditions under which the drag is allowed\nto be dragged offscreen. Allowing offscreen dragging can be\ndangerous to use with drag_joined or drags that can change\nsize, as the drags can leave the screen entirely, with no\nway to get them back on the screen.\n\nThis should be one of:\n\nFalse\nTo disallow dragging the drag offscreen. (The default)\n\nTrue\nTo allow dragging offscreen, in any direction.\n\n\"horizontal\"\nTo allow dragging offscreen in the horizontal direction only.\n\n\"vertical\"\nTo allow dragging offscreen in the vertical direction only.\n\n(width, height)\nBoth width and height must be integers. The drag can be\ndragged offscreen as long as a (width, height)-sized part\nof it remains on-screen. So, (100, 100) will ensure that\nat least a 100x100 pixel area of the displayable will\nremain on-screen even while the rest of the displayable\ncan be dragged offscreen. Setting this to the width and\nheight of the displayable being dragged is equivalent to\nnot allowing the drag to go offscreen at all.\n\n(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y)\nWhere each of min_x, max_x, min_y, and max_y are integers.\nmin_x is the number of pixels away from the left border,\nand max_x is the number of pixels away from the right\nborder. The same goes for min_y and max_y on the top and\nbottom borders respectively. The drag can be moved until\none of its edges hit the specified border. (0, 0, 0, 0)\nis equivalent to not allowing dragging offscreen at all.\n\nFor example, (-100, 200, 0, 0) would allow the drag to be\ndragged 100 pixels off the left edge of the screen and 200\npixels off the right edge of the screen, but does not\nallow it to be dragged offscreen at the top nor bottom.\n\nThis can also be used to constrain the drag within the\nscreen bounds. (200, -200, 200, -200) would only allow\nthe drag within 200 pixels of the edges of the screen.\n\nYou can envision this as an additional \"border\" around\nthe drag, which may go outside the bounds of the screen,\nthat constrains the drag to remain within it.\n\ncallable\nA callable can be provided to drag_offscreen. It must\ntake two arguments: an x and a y position which\nrepresents the dragged position of the top left corner of\nthe drag, and it must return an (x, y) tuple which is the\nnew (x, y) position the drag should be in. This callable\nis called frequently, whenever the drag is moved. For\nexample, the following function snaps the drag into place\nevery 300 pixels\n\n```\ndef drag_snap(x, y):\n\n    if y < 300:\n        y = 0\n    elif y < 600:\n        y = 300\n    else:\n        y = 600\n        \n    return 200, y\n    \n```\n\n`mouse_drop`\nIf true, the drag is dropped on the first droppable under the cursor.\nIf false, the default, the drag is dropped onto the droppable with\nthe largest degree of overlap.\n\n`drop_allowable`\nA callback that is called to determine whether this drop will allow\nthe current drags to be dropped onto it. It is called with two arguments.\nThe first is the Drag which determines its sensitivity.\nThe second is a list of Drags that are being dragged.\n\n`snapped`\nA callback (or list of callbacks) that is called when the Drag completes\na snap animation. It is called with four arguments. The first is the\nDrag which was undergoing the snap animation. The second and third are\nthe x and y coordinates where the Drag was set to snap to. The fourth\nis a boolean which is True if the snap animation was successfully\ncompleted, and False if it was interrupted (e.g. from being grabbed in\nthe middle of snapping). For example, the following function sets\nthe drag's start_x and start_y position to its intended end position\nif the snap animation was interrupted\n\n```\ndef snapped_callback(drag, x, y, completed):\n    if not completed:\n        drag.start_x = x\n        drag.start_y = y\n        \n        \n```\n\nExcept for `d`, all of the parameters are available as fields (with\nthe same name) on the Drag object. In addition, after the drag has\nbeen rendered, the following fields become available:\n\n`x`, `y`\nThe position of the Drag relative to its parent, in pixels.\n\n`start_x`, `start_y`\nThe drag start position of the Drag relative to its parent, in pixels.\n\n`grab_x`, `grab_y`\nThe x and y positions, relative to its parent, where the drag was\npicked up, in pixels.\n\n`last_drop`\nThe last Drag that the current Drag can be dropped on if released,\nor None if no valid Drag currently exists.\n\n`snapping`\nTrue if this Drag is in the middle of a snapping animation.\n\n`w`, `h`\nThe width and height of the Drag's child, in pixels.\n\n.. method:: bottom()\n\nLowers this displayable to the bottom of its drag_group.\n\n.. method:: set_child(d)\n\nChanges the child of this drag to `d`.\n\n.. method:: snap(x, y, delay=0, warper=None)\n\nChanges the position of the drag.

This includes lists, dictionaries (with strings as keys),\nstrings, numbers, True, False, and None. See\n`the Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#encoders-and-decoders>`__\nabout interoperability, how data converts between the two formats,\nand the various associated pitfalls.\n\nThe two levels of the database are dictionaries both keyed by strings.\nThe first level is read only - when a key on the first level dictionary\nis accessed, a second level dictionary is created, optionally with\ndefault contents. The second level dictionary is read-write, and\nwhen one of the keys in a second level dictionary is changed,\nthat change is saved to the database whe the game exits.\n\nLike other persistent data, JSONDBs do not participate in rollback.\n\nA JSONDB should be created during init (in an init python block or\ndefine statement), and will automatically be saved to the disk provided\nat least one key in the dictionary is set. For example\n\n```\ndefine balloonData = JSONDB(\"balloon.json\", default={ \"enabled\" : False })\n\n```\n\nThis creates a JSONDB that is stored in the file balloon.json, and has a\ndefault values. The second leval values can be used as normal dictionaries\n\n```\nscreen say(who, what):\n\n    default bd = balloonData[renpy.get_translation_identifier()]\n    \n    if bd[\"enabled\"]:\n        use balloon_say(who, what)\n    else:\n        use adv_say(who, what)\n        \n    if config.developer:\n        textbutton \"Dialogue Balloon Mode\":\n            action ToggleDict(bd, \"enabled\")\n            \n```\n\nThe JSONDB constructor takes the following arguments:\n\n`filename`\nThe filename the database is stored in. This is relative to the\ngame directory. It's recommended that the filename end in \".json\".\n\n`default`\nIf this is not None, it should be a dictionary.

This object should\nnot be stored except as part of the parse result of the statement.\n\nWhen the statement returned from this completes, control is\ntransferred to the statement after the creator-defined statement.\n(Which might be the statement created using post_execute).\n\n.. method:: renpy_block(empty=False)\n\nParse all of the remaining lines in the current block\nas Ren'Py script, and return a SubParse corresponding to the\nfirst statement in the block. The block is chained together such\nthat all statements in the block are run, and then control is\ntransferred to the statement after this creator-defined statement.\n\nNote that this parses the current block.

If this is left at the default of \"movie\", and `play`\nis provided, a channel name is automatically selected, using\nconfig.single_movie_channel and config.auto_movie_channel.\n\n`play`\nIf given, this should be the path to a movie file, or a list\nof paths to movie files. These movie\nfiles will be automatically played on `channel` when the Movie is\nshown, and automatically stopped when the movie is hidden.\n\n`side_mask`\nIf true, this tells Ren'Py to use the side-by-side mask mode for\nthe Movie. In this case, the movie is divided in half. The left\nhalf is used for color information, while the right half is used\nfor alpha information. The width of the displayable is half the\nwidth of the movie file.\n\nWhere possible, `side_mask` should be used over `mask` as it has\nno chance of frames going out of sync.\n\n`mask`\nIf given, this should be the path to a movie file, or a list of paths\nto movie files, that are used as\nthe alpha channel of this displayable.

(For example, this can be used\nto create a slimmed-down mobile version that does not use movie\nsprites.) Users can also choose to fall back to this image as a\npreference if video is too taxing for their system. The image will\nalso be used if the video plays, and then the movie ends, unless\n`group` is given.\n\n`play_callback`\nIf not None, a function that's used to start the movies playing.\n(This may do things like queue a transition between sprites, if\ndesired.) It's called with the following arguments:\n\n`old`\nThe old Movie object, or None if the movie is not playing.\n`new`\nThe new Movie object.\n\nA movie object has the `play` parameter available as ``_play``,\nwhile the ``channel``, ``loop``, ``mask``, and ``mask_channel`` fields\ncorrespond to the given parameters.\n\nGenerally, this will want to use renpy.music.play to start\nthe movie playing on the given channel, with synchro_start=True.\nA minimal implementation is\n\n```\ndef play_callback(old, new):\n\n    renpy.music.play(new._play, channel=new.channel, loop=new.loop, synchro_start=True)\n    \n    if new.mask:\n        renpy.music.play(new.mask, channel=new.mask_channel, loop=new.loop, synchro_start=True)\n        \n```\n\n`loop`\nIf False, the movie will not loop. If `image` is defined, the image\nwill be displayed when the movie ends. Otherwise, the displayable will\nbecome transparent.\n\n`group`\nIf not None, this should be a string. If given, and if the movie has not\nyet started playing, and another movie in the same group has played in\nthe previous frame, the last frame from that movie will be used for\nthis movie. This can prevent flashes of transparency when switching\nbetween two movies.\n\n`keep_last_frame`\nIf true, and the movie has ended, the last frame will be displayed,\nrather than the movie being hidden. This only works if `loop` is\nfalse. (This behavior will also occur if `group` is set.)\n\n`oversample`\nIf this is greater than 1, the movieis considered to be oversampled,\nwith more pixels than its logical size would imply. For example, if\nan movie file is 1280x720 and oversample is 2, then the image will\nbe treated as a 640x360 movie for the purpose of layout.\n\nIf None, Ren'Py will automatically determine oversamping. If an @ followed\nby a number is found in the filename, that number will be used as the the\noversampling factor. Otherwise, Ren'Py will search for files and use those.\n\nSpecifically, if :file`launch.webm` is used, Ren'Py will search for launch@2.webm\nif the movie is scaled up more than 1x, and launch@4.webm and launch@3.webm\nif the movie is scaled up more than 2x.\n\nAutomatic oversampling of movies only happens when the movie begins playing.\n\n"

These can be used to move around side images, or\nuse a transition to go between side images.\n\nThis causes the side image to slide in and out when the character\nassociated with that image changes\n\n```\ntransform change_transform(old, new):\n    contains:\n        old\n        yalign 1.0\n        xpos 0.0 xanchor 0.0\n        linear 0.2 xanchor 1.0\n    contains:\n        new\n        yalign 1.0\n        xpos 0.0 xanchor 1.0\n        linear 0.2 xanchor 0.0\n        \ndefine config.side_image_change_transform = change_transform\n\n```\n\nThis is used to dissolve between old and new side images when the\ncharacter remains the same. (For example, when the character changes\nemotion.) For the Dissolve to work correctly, both side images must\nbe the same size. \n\n```\ntransform same_transform(old, new):\n    old\n    new with Dissolve(0.2, alpha=True)\n    \ndefine config.side_image_same_transform = same_transform\n\n\n```\n\nWhen the SideImage is scaled down, it might make sense to enable\nmipmapping in the Dissolve\n\n```\ntransform same_transform(old, new):\n    old\n    new with Dissolve(0.2, alpha=True, mipmap=True)\n    \ndefine config.side_image_same_transform = same_transform\n\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n.. Automatically generated file - do not modify.\n\n.. function:: renpy.get_side_image(prefix_tag, image_tag=None, not_showing=None, layer=None)\n\nThis attempts to find an image to show as the side image.\n\nIt begins by determining a set of image attributes. If `image_tag` is\ngiven, it gets the image attributes from the tag. Otherwise, it gets\nthem from the image property suplied to the currently showing character.\nIf no attributes are available, this returns None.\n\nIt then looks up an image with the tag `prefix_tag`, and attributes\nconsisting of:\n\n* An image tag (either from `image_tag` or the image property supplied\nto the currently showing character).\n* The attributes.\n\nIf such an image exists, it's returned.\n\n`not_showing`\nIf not showing is True, this only returns a side image if an image\nwith the tag that the attributes are taken from is not currently\nbeing shown. If False, it will always return an image, if possible.\nIf None, takes the value from config.side_image_only_not_showing.\n\n`layer`\nIf given, the layer to look for the image tag and attributes on. If\nNone, uses the default layer for the tag.\n\n.. function:: renpy.set_tag_attributes(name, layer=None)\n\nThis sets the attributes associated with an image tag when that image\ntag is not showing. The main use of this would be to directly set the\nattributes used by a side image.\n\nFor example\n\n```\n$ renpy.set_tag_attributes(\"lucy mad\")\n$ renpy.say(l, \"I'm rather cross.\")\n\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nl mad \"I'm rather cross.\"\n\n```\n\nare equivalent.\n\n"

(These are only used when\ngenerating images, and will not take effect until images are regenerated\nin the launcher.)\n\nIn additional to gui.text_font, the following variables selects the\nfonts used for text. These fonts should also be placed in the game directory.\n\n.. var:: gui.interface_text_font = \"ArchitectsDaughter.ttf\"\n\nThe font used for text for user interface elements, like the main and\ngame menus, buttons, and so on.\n\n.. var:: gui.system_font = \"DejaVuSans.ttf\"\n\nThe font used for system text, like exception messages and the shift+A\naccessibility menu. This should be able to handle both ASCII and the\ngame's translated language.\n\n.. var:: gui.glyph_font = \"DejaVuSans.ttf\"\n\nA font used for certain glyphs, such as the arrow glyphs used by the skip\nindicator. DejaVuSans is a reasonable default for these glyphs, and is\nautomatically included with every Ren'Py game.\n\nIn addition to gui.text_size and gui.name_text_size, the following\nvariables control text sizes.\n\n.. var:: gui.interface_text_size = 36\n\nThe size of static text in the game's user interface, and the default size\nof button text in the game's interface.\n\n.. var:: gui.label_text_size = 45\n\nThe size of section labels in the game's user interface.\n\n.. var:: gui.notify_text_size = 24\n\nThe size of notification text.\n\n.. var:: gui.title_text_size = 75\n\nThe size of the game's title.\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\n.. figure:: gui/text.jpg\n:width: 100%\n\nThe game menu after customizing text colors, fonts, and sizes.\n\nBorders\n-------\n\nThere are a number of GUI components \u2013 such as buttons and bars \u2013 that use\nscalable backgrounds configured using Border objects. Before discussing,\nhow to customize buttons and bars, we'll first describe how this works.\n\nBorders are given to the Frame displayable.\nA Frame takes an image, and divides it into nine parts \u2013 the four corners,\nthe four sides, and the center. The corners always remain the same size,\nthe left and right sides are stretched vertically, the top and bottom sides\nare stretched horizontally, and the center is stretched in both directions.\n\nA Borders object gives the size of each of the borders, in left, top, right,\nbottom order. So if the following border image is used:\n\n.. image:: oshs/game/images/borders.png\n\nalong with the following borders\n\n```\nBorders(40, 40, 40, 40)\n\n```\n\none possible result is this:\n\n.. image:: gui/borders1.png\n\nAs the child changes size, so will the background.\n\nA Border object can also be given padding, including negative padding that\ncauses the child to overlap the borders. For example, these borders\n\n```\nBorders(40, 40, 40, 40, -20, -20, -20, -20)\n\n```\n\nallow the child to overlap the sides. Note that due to this overlap, the\nresult is smaller, since the borders themselves now take up less space.\n\n.. image:: gui/borders2.png\n\nBorders can also be tiled, rather than scaled. This is invoked by variables,\nand produces this result.\n\n.. image:: gui/borders3.png\n\nThese example images are a bit ugly, since we need to show what's going on.\nIn practice, this system can produce quite pleasing results. This is the case when\na Frame displayable is used as the background of a frame window holding\nuser interface components.\n\nThese frame windows can be customized in two ways. The first is by changing the\nbackground image file:\n\ngui/frame.png\nThe image used as the background of frames windows.\n\nAnd the second is by customizing variables.\n\n.. var:: gui.frame_borders = Borders(15, 15, 15, 15)\n\nThe borders applied to frame windows.\n\n.. var:: gui.confirm_frame_borders = Borders(60, 60, 60, 60)\n\nThe borders applied to the fame used in the confirm screen.\n\n.. var:: gui.frame_tile = True\n\nIf true, the sides and center of the confirm screen are tiled. If false,\nthey are scaled.\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/frame.png\n:width: 100%\n\nAn example gui/frame.png image.\n\n.. figure:: gui/frame_confirm.jpg\n:width: 100%\n\nThe confirm screen after applying the customizations given\nabove.\n\nButtons\n-------\n\nThe Ren'Py user interface includes a large number of buttons, buttons\nthat come in different sizes and that are used for different purposes.\nThe various kinds of buttons are:\n\nbutton\nA basic button. Used for navigation within the user interface.\n\nchoice_button\nA button used for choices in the in-game menu.\n\nquick_button\nA button, displayed in-game, that is intended to allow quick access\nto the game menu.\n\nnavigation_button\nA button used in main and game menu for navigation between screens,\nand to start the game.\n\npage_button\nA button used to switch between pages on the load and save screens.\n\nslot_button\nButtons that represent file slots, and contain a thumbnail, the save\ntime, and an optional save name. These are described in more detail\nbelow.\n\nradio_button\nA button used for multiple-choice preferences on the preferences\nscreen.\n\ncheck_button\nA button used for toggleable preferences on the preferences screen.\n\ntest_button\nA button used to test audio playback on the preferences screen. This\nshould be the same height as a horizontal slider.\n\nhelp_button\nA button used to select what kind of help the player wants.\n\nconfirm_button\nA button used on the confirm screen to select yes or no.\n\nnvl_button\nA button used for an NVL-mode menu choice.\n\nThe following image files are used to customize button backgrounds,\nif they exist.\n\ngui/button/idle_background.png\nThe background image used by buttons that are not focused.\n\ngui/button/hover_background.png\nThe background image used by buttons that are focused.\n\ngui/button/selected_idle_background.png\nThe background image used by buttons that are selected but not\nfocused. This is optional, and is used in preference to\nidle_background.png if it exists.\n\ngui/button/selected_hover_background.png\nThe background image used by buttons that are selected but not\nfocused. This is optional, and is used in preference to\nhover_background.png if it exists.\n\nMore specific backgrounds can be given for each kind of button, by\nprefixing it with the kind. For example, gui/button/check_idle_background.png\nis used as the background of check buttons that are not focused.\n\nFour image files are used as foreground decorations on radio and check\nbuttons, to indicate if the option is chosen or not.\n\ngui/button/check_foreground.png, gui/button/radio_foreground.png\nThese images are used when a check or radio button is not selected.\n\ngui/button/check_selected_foreground.png, gui/button/radio_selected_foreground.png\nThese images are used when a check or radio button is selected.\n\n\nThe following variables set various properties of buttons:\n\n.. var:: gui.button_width = None\n.. var:: gui.button_height = 64\n\nThe width and height of a button, in pixels. If None, the size is\nautomatically determined based on the size of the text inside a button,\nand the borders given below.\n\n.. var:: gui.button_borders = Borders(10, 10, 10, 10)\n\nThe borders surrounding a button, in left, top, right, bottom order.\n\n.. var:: gui.button_tile = True\n\nIf true, the sides and center of the button background are tiled to\nincrease or  decrease their size. If false, the sides and center are\nscaled.\n\n.. var:: gui.button_text_font = gui.interface_font\n.. var:: gui.button_text_size = gui.interface_text_size\n\nThe font and size of the button text.\n\n.. var:: gui.button_text_idle_color = gui.idle_color\n.. var:: gui.button_text_hover_color = gui.hover_color\n.. var:: gui.button_text_selected_color = gui.accent_color\n.. var:: gui.button_text_insensitive_color = gui.insensitive_color\n\nThe color of the button text in various states.\n\n.. var:: gui.button_text_xalign = 0.0\n\nThe horizontal alignment of the button text. 0.0 is left-aligned,\n0.5 is centered, and 1.0 is right-aligned.\n\n.. var:: gui.button_image_extension = \".png\"\n\nThe extension for button images. This could be changed to .webp\nto use WEBP button images instead of png ones.\n\nThese variables can be prefixed with the button kind to configure a\nproperty for a particular kind of button. For example,\ngui.choice_button_text_idle_color configures the color of\nan idle choice button.\n\nFor example, we customize these variables in our sample game.\n\n.. var:: gui.navigation_button_width = 290\n\nIncreases the width of navigation buttons.\n\n.. var:: gui.radio_button_borders = Borders(40, 10, 10, 10)\n.. var:: gui.check_button_borders = Borders(40, 10, 10, 10)\n\nIncreases the width of radio and check button borders, leaving extra\nspace on the left for the check mark.\n\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\nHere's an example of how the play screen can be customized.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/button/idle_background.png\n\nAn example gui/button/idle_background.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/button/hover_background.png\n\nAn example gui/button/hover_background.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/button/check_foreground.png\n\nAn image that can be used as gui/button/check_foreground.png and\ngui/button/radio_foreground.png.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/button/check_selected_foreground.png\n\nAn image that can be used as gui/button/check_selected_foreground.png and\ngui/button/radio_selected_foreground.png.\n\n.. figure:: gui/button_preferences.jpg\n:width: 100%\n\nThe preferences screen with the customizations described in this\nsection applied.\n\nSave Slot Buttons\n------------------\n\nThe load and save screens use slot buttons, which are buttons that present\na thumbnail and information about when the file was saved. The following\nvariables are quite useful when it comes to customizing the size of\nthe save slots.\n\n.. var:: gui.slot_button_width = 414\n.. var:: gui.slot_button_height = 309\n\nThe width and height of the save slot button.\n\n.. var:: gui.slot_button_borders = Borders(15, 15, 15, 15)\n\nThe borders applied to each save slot.\n\nconfig.thumbnail_width = 384 and config.thumbnail_height = 216\nset the width and height of the save thumbnails. Note that these live in\nthe config namespace, not the gui namespace. These do not take effect\nuntil the file is saved and loaded.\n\n.. var:: gui.file_slot_cols = 3\n.. var:: gui.file_slot_rows = 2\n\nThe number of columns and rows in the grid of save slots.\n\nThere are the background images used for save slots.\n\ngui/button/slot_idle_background.png\nThe image used for the background of save slots that are not focused.\n\ngui/button/slot_hover_background.png\nThe image used for the background of save slots that are focused.\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\nPutting those to use, we get:\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/button/slot_idle_background.png\n\nAn example gui/button/slot_idle_background.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/button/slot_hover_background.png\n\nAn example gui/button/slot/slot_hover_background.png image.\n\n.. figure:: gui/slot_save.jpg\n\nThe save screen after applying the customizations given in this\nsection.\n\nSliders\n-------\n\nSliders are a type of bar that is used in the preferences screen to\nallow the player to adjust preference with a large number of values.\nBy default, the GUI only uses horizontal sliders, but a game\nmay also use vertical sliders.\n\nSliders are customized with the following images:\n\ngui/slider/horizontal_idle_bar.png, gui/slider/horizontal_hover_bar.png, gui/slider/vertical_idle_bar.png, gui/slider/vertical_hover_bar.png\nImages used for vertical and idle bar backgrounds in idle and\nhover states.\n\ngui/slider/horizontal_idle_thumb.png, gui/slider/horizontal_hover_thumb.png, gui/slider/vertical_idle_thumb.png, gui/slider/vertical_hover_thumb.png\nImages used for the thumb \u2013 the movable part of the bar.\n\nThe following variables are also used:\n\n.. var:: gui.slider_size = 64\n\nThe height of horizontal sliders, and width of vertical sliders.\n\n.. var:: gui.slider_tile = True\n\nIf true, the frame containing the bar of a slider is tiled. If False,\nif it scaled.\n\n.. var:: gui.slider_borders = Borders(6, 6, 6, 6)\n.. var:: gui.vslider_borders = Borders(6, 6, 6, 6)\n\nThe borders that are used with the Frame containing the bar image.\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\nHere's an example of how we customize the horizontal slider.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/slider/horizontal_idle_bar.png\n\nAn example gui/slider/horizontal_idle_bar.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/slider/horizontal_hover_bar.png\n\nAn example gui/slider/horizontal_hover_bar.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/slider/horizontal_idle_thumb.png\n\nAn example gui/slider/horizontal_idle_thumb.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/slider/horizontal_hover_thumb.png\n\nAn example gui/slider/horizontal_hover_thumb.png image.\n\n.. figure:: gui/slider_preferences.jpg\n:width: 100%\n\nThe preferences screen after applying the customizations given in this\nsection.\n\n\n\nScrollbars\n----------\n\nScrollbars are bars that are used to scroll viewports. In the GUI,\nthe most obvious place a scrollbar is used is the history screen,\nbut vertical scrollbars can be used on other screens as well.\n\nSliders are customized with the following images:\n\ngui/scrollbar/horizontal_idle_bar.png, gui/scrollbar/horizontal_hover_bar.png, gui/scrollbar/vertical_idle_bar.png, gui/scrollbar/vertical_hover_bar.png\nImages used for vertical and idle bar backgrounds in idle and\nhover states.\n\ngui/scrollbar/horizontal_idle_thumb.png, gui/scrollbar/horizontal_hover_thumb.png, gui/scrollbar/vertical_idle_thumb.png, gui/scrollbar/vertical_hover_thumb.png\nImages used for the thumb \u2013 the movable part of the bar.\n\nThe following variables are also used:\n\n.. var:: gui.scrollbar_size = 24\n\nThe height of horizontal scrollbars, and width of vertical scrollbars.\n\n.. var:: gui.scrollbar_tile = True\n\nIf true, the frame containing the bar of a scrollbar is tiled. If False,\nif it scaled.\n\n.. var:: gui.scrollbar_borders = Borders(10, 6, 10, 6)\n.. var:: gui.vscrollbar_borders = Borders(6, 10, 6, 10)\n\nThe borders that are used with the Frame containing the bar image.\n\n.. var:: gui.unscrollable = \"hide\"\n\nThis controls what to do if the bar is unscrollable. \"hide\" hides\nthe bar, while None keeps it shown.\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\nHere's an example of how we customize the vertical scrollbar.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/scrollbar/vertical_idle_bar.png\n:height: 150\n\nAn example gui/scrollbar/vertical_idle_bar.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/scrollbar/vertical_hover_bar.png\n:height: 150\n\nAn example gui/scrollbar/vertical_hover_bar.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/scrollbar/vertical_idle_thumb.png\n:height: 150\n\nAn example gui/scrollbar/vertical_idle_thumb.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/scrollbar/vertical_hover_thumb.png\n:height: 150\n\nAn example gui/scrollbar/vertical_hover_thumb.png image.\n\n.. figure:: gui/scrollbar_history.jpg\n:width: 100%\n\nThe history screen after applying the customizations given in this\nsection.\n\nBars\n----\n\nPlain old bars are used to display a number to the player. They're not\nused in the GUI, but can be used in creator-defined screens.\n\nA bar can customized by editing the following images:\n\ngui/bar/left.png, gui/bar/bottom.png\nImages that are used for the filled section of horizontal and vertical bars.\n\ngui/bar/right.png, gui/bar/top.png\nImages that are used for the filled section of horizontal and vertical bars.\n\nThere are also the usual variables that control bars:\n\n.. var:: gui.bar_size = 64\n\nThe height of horizontal bars, and width of vertical bars.\n\n.. var:: gui.bar_tile = False\n\nIf true, the bar images are tiled. If false, the images are linearly\nscaled.\n\n.. var:: gui.bar_borders = Borders(10, 10, 10, 10)\n.. var:: gui.vbar_borders = Borders(10, 10, 10, 10)\n\nThe borders that are used with the Frames containing the bar images.\n\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\nHere's an example of how we customize horizontal bars.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/bar/left.png\n:width: 100%\n\nAn example gui/bar/left.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/bar/right.png\n:width: 100%\n\nAn example gui/bar/right.png image.\n\n.. figure:: gui/bar.jpg\n:width: 100%\n\nA screen we defined to give an example of a bar.\n\n\nSkip and Notify\n---------------\n\nThe skip and notify screens both display frames with messages in them. Both\nuse custom frame background images:\n\n\ngui/skip.png\nThe background of the skip indicator.\n\ngui/notify.png\nThe background of the notify screen.\n\nThe variables that control these are:\n\n.. var:: gui.skip_frame_borders = Borders(24, 8, 75, 8)\n\nThe borders of the frame that is used by the skip screen.\n\n.. var:: gui.notify_frame_borders = Borders(24, 8, 60, 8)\n\nThe borders of the frame that is used by the notify screen.\n\n.. var:: gui.skip_ypos = 15\n\nThe vertical position of the skip indicator, in pixels from the top of the\nwindow.\n\n.. var:: gui.notify_ypos = 68\n\nThe vertical position of the notify message, in pixels from the top of the\nwindow.\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\nHere is an example of customizing the skip and notify screens.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/skip.png\n:width: 100%\n\nAn example gui/skip.png image.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/notify.png\n:width: 100%\n\nAn example gui/notify.png image.\n\n.. figure:: gui/skip_notify.jpg\n\nThese skip and notify screens in action.\n\nDialogue, Continued\n-------------------\n\nIn addition to the simple customizations given above, there are a number\nof ways to control how dialogue is presented to the player.\n\nTextbox\n^^^^^^^\n\nThe textbox (or window) is the window the dialogue is displayed in. In addition\nto changing gui/textbox.png, the following variables control how the textbox\nis displayed.\n\n.. var:: gui.textbox_height = 278\n\nThe height of the textbox window, which should also be the height of gui/\ntextbox.png.\n\n.. var:: gui.textbox_yalign = 1.0\n\nThe placement of the textbox vertically on the screen. 0.0 is the top,\n0.5 is center, and 1.0 is the bottom.\n\nName and Namebox\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe character's name is placed inside a frame that uses gui/namebox.png as\nits background. In addition, there are a number of variables that control\nthe presentation of the name. The namebox is only show if the speaking character\nhas a name (an empty name, like \" \", counts).\n\n.. var:: gui.name_xpos = 360\n.. var:: gui.name_ypos = 0\n\nThe horizontal and vertical positions of the name and namebox. These\nare usually a number of pixels from the left or top side of the textbox.\nSetting a variable to 0.5 centers the name in the textbox (see below).\nThese numbers can also be negative \u2013 for example, setting gui.name_ypos\nto -22 causes it to be places 22 pixels above the top of the textbox.\n\n.. var:: gui.name_xalign = 0.0\n\nThe horizontal alignment of the character's name. This can be 0.0 for left-\naligned, 0.5 for centered, and 1.0 for right-aligned. (It's almost always\n0.0 or 0.5.) This is used for both the position of the namebox relative\nto gui.name_xpos, and to select the side of of the namebox that is aligned\nwith xpos.\n\n.. var:: gui.namebox_width = None\n.. var:: gui.namebox_height = None\n.. var:: gui.namebox_borders = Borders(5, 5, 5, 5)\n.. var:: gui.namebox_tile = False\n\nThese variables control the display of the frame containing the namebox.\n\nDialogue\n^^^^^^^^\n\n.. var:: gui.dialogue_xpos = 402\n.. var:: gui.dialogue_ypos = 75\n\nThe horizontal and vertical positions of the actual dialogue. These\nare usually a number of pixels from the left or top side of the textbox.\nSetting a variable to 0.5 centers the dialogue in the textbox (see below).\n\n.. var:: gui.dialogue_width = 1116\n\nThis variable gives the maximum width of a line of dialogue, in pixels.\nWhen dialogue reaches this width, it will be wrapped by Ren'Py.\n\n.. var:: gui.dialogue_text_xalign = 0.0\n\nThe horizontal alignment of dialogue text. 0.0 is left aligned, 0.5 is\ncentered, and 1.0 is right-aligned.\n\nExamples\n^^^^^^^^\n\nTo center the character's name, use\n\n```\ndefine gui.name_xpos = 0.5\ndefine gui.name_xalign = 0.5\n\n```\n\nTo center dialogue text, use\n\n```\ndefine gui.dialogue_xpos = 0.5\ndefine gui.dialogue_text_xalign = 0.5\n\n```\n\nOur example game uses these statements to customize the centered namebox\n\n```\ndefine gui.namebox_width = 300\ndefine gui.name_ypos = -22\ndefine gui.namebox_borders = Borders(15, 7, 15, 7)\ndefine gui.namebox_tile = True\n\n```\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/namebox.png\n\nAn example gui/namebox.png image.\n\n.. figure:: gui/intermediate_dialogue.jpg\n:width: 100%\n\nThe example game, customized with the settings above.\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThere are a few variables that control the way the history screen\nis displayed.\n\nThe config.history_length variable, which defaults to 250,\nsets the number of blocks of dialogue Ren'Py will keep at history.\n\n.. var:: gui.history_height = 210\n\nThe height of a history entry, in pixels. This can be None to allow\nthe height of a history entry to vary at the cost of performance \u2013\nconfig.history_length may need to be lowered significantly when this\nis None.\n\n.. var:: gui.history_spacing = 0\n\nThe amount of space to leave between history entries, in pixels.\n\n.. var:: gui.history_name_xpos = 0.5\n.. var:: gui.history_text_xpos = 0.5\n\nThe horizontal positions of the name label and dialogue text. These\ncan be a number of pixels from the left side of the history entry,\nor 0.5 to center.\n\n.. var:: gui.history_name_ypos = 0\n.. var:: gui.history_text_ypos = 60\n\nThe vertical positions of the name label and dialogue text, relative\nto the top of a history entry, in pixels.\n\n\n.. var:: gui.history_name_width = 225\n.. var:: gui.history_text_width = 1110\n\nThe width of the name label and dialogue text, in pixels.\n\n.. var:: gui.history_name_xalign = 0.5\n.. var:: gui.history_text_xalign = 0.5\n\nThis controls the alignment of text and the side of the text that is\naligned with xpos. 0.0 is left-aligned, 0.5 is center-aligned, 1.0 is\nright-aligned.\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\n.. figure:: gui/history.png\n:width: 100%\n\nThe history screen customized with the settings given above.\n\n\nNVL\n---\n\nThe nvl screen displays NVL-mode dialogue. There are a number of ways it\ncan be customized. The first is to customize the NVL-mode background image:\n\ngui/nvl.png\nThe background image used in NVL-mode. This should be the same size as\nthe game window.\n\nThere are also a number of variables that are used to customize the way\nNVL-mode text is displayed.\n\n\n.. var:: gui.nvl_borders = Borders(0, 15, 0, 30)\n\nThe borders around the background of the NVL-mode. Since the\nbackground is not a frame, this is only used to pad out the NVL-mode\nto prevent it from pressing up against the sides of the screen.\n\n.. var:: gui.nvl_height = 173\n\nThe height of a single NVL-mode entry. Setting this to a fixed height\nmakes it possible to have NVL-mode without paging, showing a fixed number\nof entries at once. Setting this to None allows entries to be of a\nvariable size.\n\n.. var:: gui.nvl_spacing = 15\n\nThe spacing between entries when gui.nvl_height is None, and the spacing\nbetween NVL-mode menu buttons.\n\n.. var:: gui.nvl_name_xpos = 0.5\n.. var:: gui.nvl_text_xpos = 0.5\n.. var:: gui.nvl_thought_xpos = 0.5\n\nThe positioning of character names, dialogue text, and thought/narration\ntext, relative to the left side of the entry. This can be a number of\npixels, or 0.5 to represent the center of the entry.\n\n.. var:: gui.nvl_name_xalign = 0.5\n.. var:: gui.nvl_text_xalign = 0.5\n.. var:: gui.nvl_thought_xalign = 0.5\n\nThe alignment of the text. This controls both the alignment of the text,\nand the side of the text that is placed at xpos. This can be 0.0 for left,\n0.5 for center, and 1.0 for right.\n\n.. var:: gui.nvl_name_ypos = 0\n.. var:: gui.nvl_text_ypos = 60\n.. var:: gui.nvl_thought_ypos = 0\n\nThe position of character names, dialogue text, and thought/narration text,\nrelative to the top of the entry. This should be a number of pixels from\nthe top.\n\n.. var:: gui.nvl_name_width = 740\n.. var:: gui.nvl_text_width = 740\n.. var:: gui.nvl_thought_width = 740\n\nThe width of each kind of text, in pixels.\n\n.. var:: gui.nvl_button_xpos = 0.5\n.. var:: gui.nvl_button_xalign = 0.5\n\nThe position and alignment of NVL-mode menu buttons.\n\nRen'Py does not use NVL-mode by default. It must be invoked using NVL-mode\ncharacters, and by defining a few variables in script.rpy. \n\n```\ndefine e = Character(\"Eileen\", kind=nvl)\ndefine narrator = nvl_narrator\ndefine menu = nvl_menu\n\n\n```\n\n.. ifconfig:: renpy_figures\n\nHere's an example of the NVL screen as customized with the settings above.\n\n.. figure:: oshs/game/gui/nvl.png\n\nAn example gui/nvl.png image.\n\n.. figure:: gui/nvl.jpg\n:width: 100%\n\nThe example game, customized with the settings above.\n\nText\n----\n\nMost text can be customized using GUI variables. The variables used\nare of the form:\n\n.. var:: gui.kind_text_font\n\nIf present, the font used for the text.\n\n.. var:: gui.kind_text_size\n\nIf present, the size of the text.\n\n.. var:: gui.kind_text_color\n\nIf present, the color of the text.\n\nOther text style properties cam also be\nset in the same way. For example, gui.kind_text_outlines sets the\noutlines property.\n\n\nThe kind prefix can be omitted, in which case it customizes the default look\nof text. Otherwise, it may be one of the button kinds above, or one of:\n\ninterface\nFor default text in the out-of-game interface.\n\ninput\nFor text in a text input widget.\n\ninput_prompt\nFor the prompt portion of a text input.\n\nlabel\nFor decorative labels.\n\nprompt\nFor confirmation prompts asking the player a question.\n\nname\nFor character names.\n\ndialogue\nFor dialogue.\n\nnotify\nFor notification text.\n\n\n\nFor example\n\n```\ndefine gui.dialogue_text_outlines = [ (0, \"#00000080\", 2, 2) ]\n\n```\n\nputs a drop shadow to the right of and below dialogue text.\n\n\nTranslation and GUI Variables\n-----------------------------\n\nThe gui namespace is special, in that it is saved after the init phase,\nbut before any ``translate python`` blocks are run. This makes it possible to\nchange any GUI variable in a ``translate python`` block to accommodate a second\nlanguage. For example, the following code changes the default text font\nand size. \n\n```\ntranslate japanese python:\n    gui.text_font = \"MTLc3m.ttf\"\n    gui.text_size = 24\n    \n```\n\nThere is one issue that translators need to be aware of, and that is that\nin some places in gui.rpy, one variable is assigned the value of another.\nFor example, the default gui.rpy has\n\n```\ndefine gui.interface_text_font = \"DejaVuSans.ttf\"\n\n```\n\nand later on\n\n```\ndefine gui.button_text_font = gui.interface_text_font\n\n```\n\nSince both of these statements run before any ``translate`` block runs, both\nvariables need to be changed. \n\n```\ntranslate japanese python::\n\n    define gui.interface_text_font = \"MTLc3m.ttf\"\n    define gui.button_text_font = \"MTLc3m.ttf\"\n    \n```\n\nIf the second statement was missing, DejaVuSans would still be used.\n\n.. _more_advanced_gui:\n\nAdvanced Customization\n======================\n\nMore advanced customization is possible by customizing screens.rpy,\nup to and including deleting the entire contents of the file and replacing\nit with something of your own. Here are a few places to get started.\n\nStyles\n------\n\nStyles and style properties control how displayables\nare displayed. To find out what style a displayable is using, put the mouse\nover it and type Shift+I. This invokes the style inspector, which shows\nstyle names. Once the style name is known, a style statement can be used\nto customize it.\n\nFor example, say we've lost our minds writing GUI documentation, and want to\nadd a bright red outline to the dialogue text. We can hover the text and press\nShift+I to find out the style used is named say_dialogue. We can then\nadd (to the end of screens.rpy, or somewhere in options.rpy) the style statement\n\n```\nstyle say_dialogue:\n    outlines [ (1, \"#f00\", 0, 0 ) ]\n    \n```\n\nA huge number of customizations are possible using style statements.\n\n\nScreens - Navigation\n--------------------\n\nThe next level of customization is to modify the screens. The most\nimportant documentation about screens is located in the screens\nand screen_actions sections.\n\n\nOne of the most important screens is the navigation screen, which serves\nboth as the main menu, and to provide navigation for the game menu. This\nscreen can be edited to add more buttons to one or both of those. For\nexample, by changing the navigation screen to\n\n```\nscreen navigation():\n\n    vbox:\n        style_prefix \"navigation\"\n        \n        xpos gui.navigation_xpos\n        yalign 0.5\n        \n        spacing gui.navigation_spacing\n        \n        if main_menu:\n        \n            textbutton _(\"Start\") action Start()\n            \n            textbutton _(\"Prologue\") action Start(\"prologue\")\n            \n        else:\n        \n            textbutton _(\"Codex\") action ShowMenu(\"codex\")\n            \n            textbutton _(\"History\") action ShowMenu(\"history\")\n            \n            textbutton _(\"Save\") action ShowMenu(\"save\")\n            \n        textbutton _(\"Load\") action ShowMenu(\"load\")\n        \n        textbutton _(\"Preferences\") action ShowMenu(\"preferences\")\n        \n        if _in_replay:\n        \n            textbutton _(\"End Replay\") action EndReplay(confirm=True)\n            \n        elif not main_menu:\n        \n            textbutton _(\"Main Menu\") action MainMenu()\n            \n        textbutton _(\"About\") action ShowMenu(\"about\")\n        \n        textbutton _(\"Extras\") action ShowMenu(\"extras\")\n        \n        if renpy.variant(\"pc\"):\n        \n            textbutton _(\"Help\") action ShowMenu(\"help\")\n            \n            textbutton _(\"Quit\") action Quit(confirm=not main_menu)\n            \n```\n\nWe add access to a prologue screen from the main menu, a codex screen from\nthe game menu, and an extras screen from both menus.\n\nScreens - Game Menu\n-------------------\n\nCustom game menu screens can also be created. These screens can use the\ngame_menu screen to provide a title and scrollable viewport. An minimal\ncustom game menu screen is\n\n```\nscreen codex():\n\n    tag menu\n    \n    use game_menu(_(\"Codex\"), scroll=\"viewport\"):\n    \n        style_prefix \"codex\"\n        \n        has vbox:\n            spacing 20\n            \n        text _(\"{b}Mechanical Engineering:{/b} Where we learn to build things like missiles and bombs.\")\n        \n        text _(\"{b}Civil Engineering:{/b} Where we learn to build targets.\")\n        \n```\n\nClearly, a functional codex would need to be more elaborate than this.\n\nNote the \"tag menu\" line. This line is important, as it hides other menu screens\nwhen the codex is shown. Without it, it would be hard to switch to and\nfrom the other menu screens.\n\nScreens - Click to Continue\n---------------------------\n\nA screen we expect to be commonly added is the click to continue screen. This\nis a screen that is shown when text finishes displaying. Here's a simple\nexample\n\n```\nscreen ctc(arg=None):\n\n    frame:\n        at ctc_appear\n        xalign .99\n        yalign .99\n        \n        text _(\"(click to continue)\"):\n            size 18\n            \ntransform ctc_appear:\n    alpha 0.0\n    pause 5.0\n    linear 0.5 alpha 1.0\n    \n```\n\nThis particular ctc screen uses a transform to show the frame after 5 seconds.\nIt's a good idea to delay CTC animations for several seconds, to give Ren'Py\ntime to predict and load images.\n\n\nTotal GUI Replacement\n---------------------\n\nAdvanced creators can replace some or all of screens.rpy in its entirely.\nWhen doing so, some or all of the contents of gui.rpy may become redundant.\nIt's probably a good idea to call gui.init to reset styles \u2013 but after\nthat, a creator can do whatever they want. It usually makes sense to include\nsome or all of the special screens, to make sure\nplayers can have access to all the functionality Ren'Py provides.\n\n\nSee Also\n========\n\nFor more information about the GUI, see the Advanced GUI\nsection.\n\n\n.. _gui-changes:\n\nIncompatible GUI Changes\n========================\n\nAs the GUI is changed, occasionally some of the variables change name. These\nchanges only take effect when the GUI is regenerated \u2013 until then, the game\nwill continue to use the old variable names in the new Ren'Py.\n\n6.99.12.3\n---------\n\n* gui.default_font -> gui.text_font\n* gui.name_font -> gui.name_text_font\n* gui.interface_font -> gui.interface_text_font\n* gui.text_xpos -> gui.dialogue_xpos\n* gui.text_ypos -> gui.dialogue_ypos\n* gui.text_width -> gui.dialogue_width\n* gui.text_xalign -> gui.dialogue_text_xalign\n"
