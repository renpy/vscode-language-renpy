It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible codebase to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead.\n\nIt is designed to be used as follows\n```\nfrom __future__ import (absolute_import, division,\n                            print_function, unicode_literals)\n    from builtins import (\n             bytes, dict, int, list, object, range, str,\n             ascii, chr, hex, input, next, oct, open,\n             pow, round, super,\n             filter, map, zip)\n\nfollowed by predominantly standard, idiomatic Python 3 code that then runs\nsimilarly on Python 2.6/2.7 and Python 3.3+.\n\nThe imports have no effect on Python 3. On Python 2, they shadow the\ncorresponding builtins, which normally have different semantics on Python 3\nversus 2, to provide their Python 3 semantics.\n\n\nStandard library reorganization\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``future`` supports the standard library reorganization (PEP 3108) through the\nfollowing Py3 interfaces:\n\n    >>> # Top-level packages with Py3 names provided on Py2:\n    >>> import html.parser\n    >>> import queue\n    >>> import tkinter.dialog\n    >>> import xmlrpc.client\n    >>> # etc.\n\n    >>> # Aliases provided for extensions to existing Py2 module names:\n    >>> from future.standard_library import install_aliases\n    >>> install_aliases()\n\n    >>> from collections import Counter, OrderedDict   # backported to Py2.6\n    >>> from collections import UserDict, UserList, UserString\n    >>> import urllib.request\n    >>> from itertools import filterfalse, zip_longest\n    >>> from subprocess import getoutput, getstatusoutput\n\n\nAutomatic conversion\n--------------------\n\nAn included script called `futurize\n<http://python-future.org/automatic_conversion.html>`_ aids in converting\ncode (from either Python 2 or Python 3) to code compatible with both\nplatforms. It is similar to ``python-modernize`` but goes further in\nproviding Python 3 compatibility through the use of the backported types\nand builtin functions in ``future``.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nSee: http://python-future.org\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\n:Author:  Ed Schofield, Jordan M.

When used, the default value of any argument not supplied to this Character is the value of that argument supplied to ``kind``. This can be used to define a template character, and then copy that character with changes.\n\n**Linked Image.** An image tag may be associated with a Character. This allows a say statement involving this character to display an image with the tag, and also allows Ren'Py to automatically select a side image to show when this character speaks.\n\n`image`  A string giving the image tag that is linked with this  character.\n\n**Voice Tag.** If a voice tag is assign to a Character, the voice files that are associated with it, can be muted or played in the preference screen.\n\n`voice_tag` A String that enables the voice file associated with the Character to be muted or played in the 'voice' channel.\n\n**Prefixes and Suffixes.** These allow a prefix and suffix to be applied to the name of the character, and to the text being shown. This can be used, for example, to add quotes before and after each line of dialogue.\n\n`what_prefix` A string that is prepended to the dialogue being spoken before it is shown.\n\n`what_suffix` A string that is appended to the dialogue being spoken before it is shown.\n\n`who_prefix` A string that is prepended to the name of the character before it is shown.\n\n`who_suffix` A string that is appended to the name of the character before it is shown.\n\n**Changing Name Display.** These options help to control the display of the name.\n\n`dynamic` If true, then `name` should either be a string containing a Python expression, a function, or a callable object. If it's a string, That string will be evaluated before each line of dialogue, and the result used as the name of the character. Otherwise, the function or callable object will be called with no arguments before each line of dialogue, and the return value of the call will be used as the name of the character.\n\n**Controlling Interactions.** These options control if the dialogue is displayed, if an interaction occurs, and the mode that is entered upon display.\n\n`condition` If given, this should be a string containing a Python expression. If the expression is false, the dialogue does not occur, as if the say statement did not happen.\n\n`interact` If true, the default, an interaction occurs whenever the dialogue is shown. If false, an interaction will not occur, and additional elements can be added to the screen.\n\n`advance` If true, the default, the player can click to advance through the statement, and other means of advancing (such as skip and auto-forward mode) will also work. If false, the player will be unable to move past the say statement unless an alternate means (such as a jump hyperlink or screen) is provided.\n\n`mode` A string giving the mode to enter when this character speaks. See the section on :ref:`modes <modes>` for more details.\n\n`callback` A function that is called when events occur while the character is speaking. See the section on :ref:`character-callbacks` fore more information.\n\n**Click-to-continue.** A click-to-continue indicator is displayed once all the text has finished displaying, to prompt the user to advance.\n\n`ctc` A displayable to use as the click-to-continue indicator, unless a more specific indicator is used.\n\n`ctc_pause` A displayable to use a the click-to-continue indicator when the display of text is paused by the {p} or {w} text tags.\n\n`ctc_timedpause` A displayable to use a the click-to-continue indicator when the display of text is paused by the {p=} or {w=} text tags. When None, this takes its default from `ctc_pause`, use ``Null()`` when you want a `ctc_pause` but no `ctc_timedpause`.\n\n`ctc_position` Controls the location of the click-to-continue indicator. If ``\\nestled\\``, the indicator is displayed as part of the text being shown, immediately after the last character. ``\\nestled-close\\`` is similar, except a break is not allowed between the text and the CTC indicator. If ``\\fixed\\``, the indicator is added to the screen, and its position is controlled by the position style properties.\n\n **Screens.** The display of dialogue uses a :ref:`screen <screens>`. These arguments allow you to select that screen, and to provide arguments to it.\n\n`screen` The name of the screen that is used to display the dialogue.\n\nKeyword arguments beginning with ``show_`` have the prefix stripped off, and are passed to the screen as arguments. For example, the value of ``show_myflag`` will become the value of the ``myflag`` variable in the screen. (The ``myflag`` variable isn't used by default, but can be used by a custom say screen.)\n\nOne show variable is, for historical reasons, handled by Ren'Py itself:\n\n`show_layer` If given, this should be a string giving the name of the layer to show the say screen on.\n\n**Styling Text and Windows.** Keyword arguments beginning with ``who_``, ``what_``, and ``window_`` have their prefix stripped, and are used to :ref:`style <styles>` the character name, the spoken text, and the window containing both, respectively.\n\nFor example, if a character is given the keyword argument ``who_color=\\#c8ffc8\\``, the color of the character's name is changed, in this case to green. ``window_background=\\frame.png\\`` sets the background of the window containing this character's dialogue.\n\nThe style applied to the character name, spoken text, and window can also be set this way, using the ``who_style``, ``what_style``, and ``window_style`` arguments, respectively.\n\nSetting :var:`config.character_id_prefixes` makes it possible to style other displayables as well.
